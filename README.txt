This is a small sample Chat application. You can chat with a chat bot that will give you automated replies. There are two different chat bots included in the app. Primarily when the app has internet connection and has managed to connect to an internet chat bot, it will use that. Otherwise an internal table in the app will be used.

The app contains some badly structured code and some UI layout issues.

Your task is to review the code and then find and fix as many issues as possible. You should not change or improve the functionality except for code refactorings and UI fixes (except when there is a bug of course.)

Especially we would like you to consider:

* Make sure the internet chatbot works as intended before you make any changes. If it doesn't work, please contact us.
* Nice layout with properly aligned graphics. Do not add any new graphical assets.
* Keeping the code easy to read and easy to modify
* Using Xcode's potential to help you to the fullest
* Generally agreed patterns and guidelines such as Model-View-Controller, Don't Repeat Yourself and Single Responsibility Principle.
* Best practices for IOS development
* Commit your changes to git step by step with a description of your changes and the motivation for doing them.

We would recommend that you put about 8 hours into this task.
